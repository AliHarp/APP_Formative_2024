The aim is to allow simulation models, as complex analytic tools, to run directly in the user's browser without the need to install any components on the local machine. This makes models more accessible and user-friendly, and ensures that all computations are performed locally enhances data security by keeping sensitive healthcare information within the user's own browser environment (Figure 1).

Specifically, it can improve accessibility of models for students. This can help students to learn about simulation modelling as a method of supporting operational, strategic, and supply chain resourcing, planning, and configuring. WebAssembly enables the model to run in a web browser, so students can access simulations from any device. This ensures that all students, regardless of their hardware, technical expertise, and geographical location, have equal access to learning resources (Figure 2).

Quarto is a publishing system that can generate static sites, making it a useful way of documenting code, analysis, text, and outputs. It is a great way of presenting work to project stakeholders and sharing detailed work with academic audiences. It can also be useful in education, providing a shareable book that students can follow without needing internet access. Using WebAssembly provides a way of integrating interactive code into the book, which can be changed and re-run as often as needed. \n\nTo illustrate, here are some examples of Python code blocks using Pyodide (a WebAssembly implentation of Python for Quarto, using\n[quarto-pyodide](https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/pyodide/qpyodide-acknowledgements.html) [@balamuta2024quarto]). These code cells use Python, without requiring a download or installation. You can interact with the code, modify it, and run it direclty in the browser. \n:::\n::::\n\n\n```{pyodide-python}\nx = 1493\ny = 3997 / 39\n\nprint(x + y)\n```\n\nTry this one!
