    "The use of WebAssembly has significant implications for the deployment of healthcare simulation models for NHS staff use, to support planning their services. It overcomes many of the issues of other methods of deployment, by increasing accessibility, usability, and data security. It also has the potential to address some of the challenges faced for simulation education, which include usability and democratisation of access. The learnings from use in the healthcare sector are proposed to be transferable to education. \n",

    "In everyday life we encounter the concept of simulation. Weather apps simulate patterns of rainfall and atmosphere dynamics over the coming hours and days. Simulations help understand how diseases or pollutants spread. Urban planners use simulation to study traffic patterns and plan road layouts, or flood risks to plan new developments. \n",

    "Discrete-event simulation (DES) is a type of computer simulation used to model the operation of complex systems, as a sequence of discrete events in time. Events might be arrivals, departures, starting or ending of services, or failures or repairs of resources. Many systems modelled using DES involve queues or delays, so processes are often modelled in terms of a series of queues and servers. As events usually occur at random times, and may have random effects, simulation incorporates elements of probability to reflect this real-life randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "A DES model can be seen as a computer representation of a system. Running it over time replicates the behaviour of the system over time. Simulation is often used where research on the real system is not possible, due to inaccessibility, risks, or costs. Experimentation with the simulation model is used instead of experimenting with the real system.\n",

    "Using Jupyter, models, including their source code, can be deployed as static files, interactive web pages, or hosted on platforms like GitHub, Binder, or Google Colab. They can also be shared as web apps, with user-friendly interfaces, via free platforms such as Streamlit Community Cloud. While these are convenient ways to share a model, free or limited-capacity platforms restrict the number of processors available, memory, and/or bandwidth. Some, such as ShinyApps, offer monthly paid plans to increase computational resources, which may not be budgeted into a project. In healthcare, a bigger issue is the potential need to use sensitive data or parameters, which may require a private, local instance of a model where model parameters/data are not sent to any remote servers, so server vulnerabilities are mitigated. \n",

    "A standard approach is to commit code and virtual environments files to GitHub (or alternative repository) which can then be downloaded and run locally [@monks2024towards]. Using Conda environments allows for a controlled setup that maintains dependencies without complex configurations.  For NHS users with limited technical support, this can present barriers. WebAssembly is an alternative approach for local processing which eliminates the need for complex software installation processes. Input files are used locally, and output files and data be safely exported to the users laptop or desktop. Additionally, every user accesses the same software environment directly in their browser, ensuring consistency, reliability, and reproducibility of model results.\n",
