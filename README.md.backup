# APP_Formative_2024
For UEBS APP programme to create a website link of formative work.

The webpage can be accessed [here](https://aliharp.github.io/APP_Formative_2024/)

It was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
and hosted using [GitHub pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

It implements `quarto-pyodide` https://quarto.thecoatlessprofessor.com/pyodide/qpyodide-acknowledgements.html developed by James Joseph Balamuta. The quarto-pyodide extension is a tool designed to embed interactive Python cells within an HTML document using Pyodide. This is possible because Pyodide is a Python runtime that runs entirely in the browser.
